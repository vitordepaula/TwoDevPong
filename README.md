#Two Dev Pong

###This is a simple game I developed to study Socket.io, Android Material Design and Unit Tests using JUnit, Robolectric and Mockito.

Upon launch, the game connects to a server (you need to be online: if it can't connect, the game will close).

The user can then start serving a game by clicking a button, which will open a dialog saying "waiting for someone to connect".
The names of people with open games will be on main screen. Simply touch on the name to start playing with the person.

You can change your name by touching-hold it.


When started, a split-screen "pong" game (each player only sees half of the screen).
There is no end, the game keeps going until someone decides to exit (or is disconnected from server by some error).

Exiting the game by pressing "back" or "home".
